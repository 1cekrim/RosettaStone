Hearthstone++ is hearthstone simulator using C++ with some reinforcement learning. The code is built on C++17 and can be compiled with commonly available compilers such as g++, clang++, or Microsoft Visual Studio. Hearthstone++ currently supports macOS (10.12.6 or later), Ubuntu (17.04 or later), Windows (Visual Studio 2017 or later), and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Other untested platforms that support C++17 also should be able to build Hearthstone++.
